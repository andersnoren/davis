Version 2.0.0 (2020-05-08)
-------------------------
- Removed the dark mode setting from Davis, since it added quite a bit of bulk to a theme meant to be as small as possible.
- Updated the theme description accordingly.
- Bumped "Tested up to" to 5.4.1.

- Made the Davis_Customize class use camelcase naming, and made it pluggable.
- Removed the `is_admin()` check in wp_enqueue_scripts(), since it only gets triggered on the front-end.
