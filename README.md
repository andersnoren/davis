## Contributing
Do you have a bug report or feature request? Feel free to create an issue, and I’ll take a look at it. You can also create a pull request if you have a solution ready. 

Keep in mind that I maintain my themes in my spare time. Even though I deeply appreciate any and all contributions, I can’t guarantee I’ll take a look at them quickly.
